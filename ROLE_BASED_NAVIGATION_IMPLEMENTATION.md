# Role-Based Dashboard Navigation Implementation

## Overview

Implemented role-based dashboard redirection to ensure users are directed to their appropriate dashboard when clicking the "Dashboard" link in the navigation bar.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/backend/haloai/apps/dashboard/views.py`

- Added `role_based_dashboard_redirect()` function
- Redirects users based on their role:
  - `farmer` → `/dashboard/farmer/` (Farmer Dashboard)
  - `admin` → `/dashboard/` (Admin Dashboard)
  - `community_admin` → `/dashboard/` (Community Dashboard)
  - `technician` → `/dashboard/` (Technician Dashboard)
  - Default → `/dashboard/farmer/` (fallback)

### 2. `/backend/haloai/apps/dashboard/urls.py`

- Added new URL pattern: `path("redirect/", views.role_based_dashboard_redirect, name="redirect")`

### 3. `/backend/haloai/templates/base.html`

- Updated Desktop Navigation: Changed Dashboard link from `{% url 'home:home' %}` to `{% url 'dashboard:redirect' %}`
- Updated Mobile Navigation: Changed Dashboard link from `{% url 'home:home' %}` to `{% url 'dashboard:redirect' %}`

## User Experience Flow

1. **User clicks "Dashboard" in navigation**
2. **System checks user role**
3. **User is redirected to appropriate dashboard:**
   - Farmers see their comprehensive farmer dashboard with predictions, sensor data, subscription info, etc.
   - Admins/Community Admins see general dashboard interface
   - Technicians see general dashboard interface

## Testing

Created and ran `test_role_redirect.py` which confirms:

- ✅ Farmer role → `/dashboard/farmer/`
- ✅ Admin role → `/dashboard/`
- ✅ Community Admin role → `/dashboard/`
- ✅ Technician role → `/dashboard/`

## Benefits

1. **Role-appropriate access**: Each user type sees their relevant dashboard
2. **Consistent navigation**: Single "Dashboard" link works for all user types
3. **Maintainable**: Centralized logic for role-based redirection
4. **Future-proof**: Easy to add new roles or change dashboard URLs

## Future Enhancements

- Create specific dashboards for community admins and technicians
- Add role-based navigation menu items
- Implement dashboard customization based on user permissions
