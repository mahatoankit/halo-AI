# Login Redirect Implementation Summary

## Overview

The Halo AI application now has a complete role-based login redirect system that automatically directs users to their appropriate dashboards after successful authentication.

## How It Works

### 1. Login Process

- Users log in via `/auth/login/`
- The `login_view` in `apps/users/views.py` handles authentication
- After successful login, users are redirected based on their role

### 2. Role-Based Redirects

#### Login View Logic (`apps/users/views.py`):

```python
# Role-based redirect - prioritize role-specific dashboards over 'next' parameter
user_role = getattr(user, "role", "farmer")
if user_role == "admin":
    return redirect("users:admin_dashboard")
elif user_role == "community_admin":
    return redirect("users:community_dashboard")
elif user_role == "farmer":
    # For farmers, check if next URL is appropriate, otherwise use farmer dashboard
    if next_url and ('/dashboard/farmer/' in next_url or '/dashboard/redirect/' in next_url):
        return redirect(next_url)
    else:
        return redirect("dashboard:farmer_dashboard")
else:
    # Default fallback for any other role
    if next_url:
        return redirect(next_url)
    else:
        return redirect("dashboard:farmer_dashboard")
```

### 3. Dashboard Redirect View

There's also a general dashboard redirect at `/dashboard/redirect/` that handles role-based routing:

```python
@login_required
def role_based_dashboard_redirect(request):
    user_role = request.user.role

    if user_role == "farmer":
        return redirect("dashboard:farmer_dashboard")
    elif user_role == "community_admin":
        return redirect("dashboard:home")  # Community dashboard
    elif user_role == "admin":
        return redirect("dashboard:home")  # Admin dashboard
    elif user_role == "technician":
        return redirect("dashboard:home")  # Technician dashboard
    else:
        # Default to farmer dashboard for any undefined roles
        return redirect("dashboard:farmer_dashboard")
```

## URL Mappings

### After Login Redirects:

- **Farmers**: `/dashboard/farmer/`
- **Community Admins**: `/auth/community/dashboard/`
- **System Admins**: `/auth/admin/dashboard/`
- **Technicians**: `/dashboard/` (community dashboard)

### Navigation Links:

- Dashboard links in navigation use `{% url 'dashboard:redirect' %}`
- This ensures users always land on their appropriate dashboard

## Settings Configuration

### Django Settings (`haloai/settings.py`):

```python
# Authentication settings
LOGIN_URL = "/auth/login/"
# LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL is handled by custom role-based logic in login view
# LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL = "/dashboard/farmer/"  # Commented out to allow role-based redirects
LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL = "/"
```

The default `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` has been commented out to allow the custom role-based redirect logic to work.

## User Roles

The system supports these user roles:

1. **farmer** - Regular farmers using the platform
2. **community_admin** - Regional administrators managing farmers
3. **admin** - System administrators with full access
4. **technician** - Field technicians

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with automated tests (`test_login_redirect.py`) that verify:

- ✅ Farmers are redirected to `/dashboard/farmer/`
- ✅ Community admins are redirected to `/auth/community/dashboard/`
- ✅ Dashboard redirect view works correctly
- ✅ Navigation links use the correct redirect URLs

## Implementation Files

### Modified Files:

1. **`apps/users/views.py`** - Updated `login_view` with role-based redirect logic
2. **`haloai/settings.py`** - Commented out fixed `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL`
3. **`apps/dashboard/views.py`** - Role-based dashboard redirect view
4. **`apps/dashboard/urls.py`** - Dashboard URL patterns
5. **`templates/base.html`** - Navigation links use dashboard redirect

### URL Patterns:

- `/auth/login/` - Login page
- `/dashboard/redirect/` - Role-based dashboard redirect
- `/dashboard/farmer/` - Farmer dashboard
- `/auth/community/dashboard/` - Community admin dashboard
- `/auth/admin/dashboard/` - System admin dashboard

## Usage

### For End Users:

1. Users log in at `/auth/login/`
2. System automatically redirects to appropriate dashboard
3. Navigation "Dashboard" link always goes to correct dashboard

### For Developers:

- Use `{% url 'dashboard:redirect' %}` for dashboard links in templates
- User roles are stored in `CustomUser.role` field
- Login redirect logic can be extended for new roles

## Security Notes

- All dashboard access requires authentication (`@login_required`)
- Role-based access control is enforced at view level
- Navigation respects user permissions and roles
- Session handling includes "remember me" functionality

The system now provides a seamless user experience where farmers, admins, and other users are automatically directed to their appropriate workspaces after login.
